# MDPlaygroundCore.jl

Core definitions and types for my implementation of molecular dynamics in
the MDPlayground suite.

Plans to include are:
+ [ ] Concrete phase space point types for 2D and 3D simulations
+ [ ] Abstract and concrete geometries (boxes, cylinders, balls)
+ [ ] Basic callback-like (?) functionality for boundary conditions etc.
+ [ ] Abstract potential and force descriptions + some commonly used ones
+ [ ] Potential (and force) superpositions for defining force fields
+ [ ] Abstract integrators for phase points + naive implementations

Functionality that may be added
+ Generation of force from potentials from automatic differentiation (AD)
